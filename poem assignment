    <h1>
        Day 1 of 1461
    </h1>
    <p>  i  walked in <br> 
and saw a glimpse of my new life <br>
excitement and horror was the only weight in my body <br>
i ran around trying to find my way, <br>
falling into  desks <br> 
words slipped from my lips into 
the ears of girls <br> who had no idea who i was <br>
2:40 <em>ding ding ding</em> <br> 
the day was over <br>
i walked through the hall, looking for my locker <br> meeting my lock with a frustrated twist and turn <br> instead of a handshake <br>
i got home <br>and slipped off my maroon and white saddle shoes <br>
my body met the bed <br> 
and i prepared myself <br> 
to do it all over again tomorrow </p>
